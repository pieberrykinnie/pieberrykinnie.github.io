# The History of Computing Education Research

Before we jump into the main content of this blog post, I should answer the following three questions any passerby may have:

* "Who the hell are you?"
* "What is this blog about?"
* "Why write about this?"

To those, I will reply sequentially:

* I'm Peter, currently a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Manitoba. Explore the rest of my website if you haven't already!
* This blog, and every future blog prefixed with `Cambridge HoCER`, will document my personal experience reading [The Cambridge Handbook of Computing Education Research](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-computing-education-research/F8CFAF7B81A8F6BF5C663412BA0A943D). Each blog post will feature a summary of the chapter or section, links to further readings mentioned in the book, and whatever musings I may have about them. I don't care enough to separate any of it, so if you want an unbiased experience, go read it yourself.
