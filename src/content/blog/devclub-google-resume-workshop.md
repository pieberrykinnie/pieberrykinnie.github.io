## General Tips

### Important Notes for First Resumes

  * Focus should be on college as you do more
* Beyond the Classroom: Build Your Story Now
  * You should have clubs, projects, hobbies
  * Don't have to be technical, soft skills like leadership and teamwork are great to develop

## Powering Your Bullets

### XYZ Formula

> Accomplished [X] (what you did), as measured by [Y] (the metric/result), by doing [Z] (the actions you took).

* Results-First Bullets: What You Did & Why It Matters
* Highlight Innovation: Did You Build or Improve Something? Include quantifiable data where possible
* Quantify Your Wins: Numbers Speak Volume

Examples:

* Good: Increased server query response time by 15% by restructuring API
* Bad: Participated in city hackathon working on a facial recognition project
* Good: Won second place out of 40 teams in the City Hackathon, building facial recognition software that helps detect human emotions, utilizing **Python** and **Java**

Before:

* Worked with another intern to create a speech classifier
* We worked through the entire development process to launch stage
* Language: Python

After:

* Worked with another intern to upgrade a speech language classifier app using **Python**, resulting in 95% accuracy, a 12% improvement over the old process
* Completed entire development process for app, including writing design docs, implementation of front-end tool using **Java**, going through design reviews, and launching internally

### What if I don't have work experience yet?

Experience & transferable skills can come in many forms

* Student organizations and national security chapters (e.g., NSBE, IEEE, etc.)
* Research opportunities, teaching assistantships, tutoring
* Programming competitions & hackathons
* Class & personal projects
* Tech-focused developmental programs

### Projects

* **Impact-Driven**: Quantify your achievements! Use the format

## Resume Critiques

General takeaways:

* Remove old experiences
* Make sure font size is presentable
* Make sure bullet points quantify impact
* Don't have a "Summary" section unless it's really good
* Be consistent with formatting choices
* If you put anything on your resume, be prepared to talk about it on the level of expertise you claim to have

## Q&A

* Should you include relevant information from 5 years ago?
  * It has to be *really* relevant. Know that it may look weird. Every section should say something new, so you should stick with recent experiences.
* Should you bold words on your resume?
  * It's a style choice. However, recruiters do only read resumes on average 3-5 seconds, so it might help.
  * Might help resume not look like a wall of text.
* Is there any secret sauce on resume?
  * Probably no, every recruiter has a different opinion (with exceptions like one page, XYZ format).
  * If you don't get a job because you "didn't bold something", it's probably a bad working environment.
* Red flags?
  * Caveat: Developers only see resumes after recruiters looked at it.
  * Old stuff, such as high school experience: means you haven't done anything since high school.
  * Not listing what you studied in school.
  * Inconsistent formatting.
* How do you pass ATS? Should I care about ATS to begin with?
  * Google doesn't do bots, FYI.
  * Standard formatting and listing same tech stack is the most important.
  * Injecting "white text" is possible...
  * Test by putting your resumes through PDF parsers.
* Where should you start?
  * Create your own personal website: easy HTML, JavaScript, maybe some backend. If you do use a template, they'll know and ask you about it.
  * If you look for leadership opportunities, go see what student organizations are there, leadership opportunities are there all the time.
* How should you take notes on what you've worked on in past experience?
  * Team standups where you tell your manager what you're doing, so that should happen anyway.
  * Even if weekly, write down what you do on your current project, especially your achievements.
  * Notetaking is also important for promotions, not just job seekers.
* If you were students again, how would you advance through this era of job-seeking?
  * Don't feel like you have to do projects or clubs. You come first, don't worry about what other people are doing or say what you have to do, take care of yourself.
  * Don't skip class and learn as much as possible, when you enter industry not much time to learn. Should put some flavor of AI somewhere in your resume.
  * The only way to get through is to make sure you're okay. Have some different, unrelated hobby to take a breather from CS. Be personable, don't spend all day in front of the computer. Do as many mock interviews as possible.
  * Don't force yourself to do things you don't enjoy. "Study this subject because it's useful" end of the day nobody knows what's going on. Find something that actually drives you and spend time on it, not things you don't enjoy, it's a waste of time.
* LeetCode and programming contests on resume?
  * If you're just solving puzzles, don't put that on your resume.
  * If you're actually competing in something organized, maybe.
  * Probably don't burn through LeetCode; better to spend time with a friend in a "mock interview" session and doing it on whiteboard to each other.
* Final tips?
  * Fail as much as you can, the later you go the less you're allowed to mess up.
  * Schoolwork takes as much time as you give it. Set time aside to have fun and take breaks.
  * Spend your internship learning what you hated. Look for different internships so you know what you're looking for, while you still have flexibility to do so.
  * Cultivate your relationships. The people you know will help you.
