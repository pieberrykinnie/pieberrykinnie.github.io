# Getting Started with Astro and Tailwind CSS

Building modern websites requires tools that balance developer experience with performance. In this post, I'll walk you through setting up a project with Astro and Tailwind CSS, two technologies that excel at creating fast, maintainable web applications.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern static site generator that brings several advantages:

- **Zero JavaScript by default**: Astro ships minimal JavaScript to the browser
- **Component islands**: Use React, Vue, or other frameworks only where needed
- **File-based routing**: Simple and intuitive page structure
- **Built-in optimizations**: Automatic code splitting and lazy loading

## Setting Up Your Project

Let's start by creating a new Astro project:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-project
cd my-project
npm install
```

Next, we'll add Tailwind CSS for styling:

```bash
npx astro add tailwindcss
```

This command automatically configures Tailwind CSS with your Astro project, including the necessary configuration files.

## Project Structure

A typical Astro project with Tailwind looks like this:

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable components
├── layouts/        # Page templates
├── pages/          # File-based routing
├── styles/         # Global styles
└── content/        # Markdown content
```

## Building Components

Astro components are similar to other frameworks but with some unique features:

```astro
---
// Component script (runs at build time)
interface Props {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}

const { title, description } = Astro.props;
---

<div class="card p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">{title}</h2>
  {description && (
    <p class="text-gray-600">{description}</p>
  )}
  <slot />
</div>
```

## Performance Benefits

This combination provides excellent performance:

1. **Static generation**: Pages are pre-built at compile time
2. **Minimal JavaScript**: Only essential scripts are included
3. **Optimized CSS**: Tailwind's purging removes unused styles
4. **Fast loading**: Static files serve incredibly quickly

## Course Connection

This project setup was inspired by techniques learned in COMP 2080, particularly around algorithm optimization and efficient data structures. The static site generation approach mirrors the principle of pre-computing results for faster runtime performance.

## Conclusion

Astro and Tailwind CSS create a powerful combination for modern web development. The developer experience is excellent, and the performance benefits are substantial. Whether you're building a personal blog, portfolio, or company website, this stack provides a solid foundation.

Try building something with these tools and see how they compare to your current workflow!
